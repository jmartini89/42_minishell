*/

1. Reads input.

2. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules.
These tokens are separated by metacharacters.
Alias expansion is performed by this step.

3. Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands.

4. Performs the various shell expansions,
breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames and commands and arguments.

5. Performs any necessary redirections
and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list.

6. Executes the command.

7. Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status.
